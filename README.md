"This project was designed to deepen my knowledge of intermediate Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) by creating an interactive platformer game. The core focus was on utilizing OOP concepts such as classes, constructors, methods, and collision detection while building a functional and engaging game.

Technical Details:
Canvas Rendering: The game is built using the <canvas> element in HTML5. I used JavaScript to dynamically render the player, platforms, and checkpoints onto the canvas, ensuring smooth gameplay and interaction.

Player Movement and Physics: The player character is moved using the arrow keys and spacebar for jumping. Gravity is applied through a physics engine, which I implemented to simulate real-world movement dynamics. The player's vertical velocity is adjusted over time, allowing for gravity and jump mechanics. The player’s horizontal velocity is managed based on key presses, ensuring smooth and responsive movement.

Platform Interaction and Collision Detection: Platforms are generated at specific positions on the screen. I implemented a system of collision detection, ensuring that the player interacts with platforms realistically, such as landing on platforms when falling and maintaining proper movement mechanics when the player is on a platform. This is achieved through a series of boundary checks and velocity adjustments to simulate gravity and jumping.

Checkpoint System: The game includes a checkpoint system where the player must navigate to yellow checkpoints located at various points across the platforms. I used an array of checkpoint objects, each with position and size properties. Upon collision with a checkpoint, the player can claim it, causing the checkpoint to disappear. Players can only reach subsequent checkpoints if the previous ones have been claimed. This logic is controlled through an array of checkpoint rules, verifying the player’s proximity and ensuring correct checkpoint progression.

Collision Detection Logic: Collision detection for both platforms and checkpoints was achieved using conditional checks that verify the player’s position relative to the objects they are interacting with. For platforms, I checked for overlap between the player's bounding box and the platform’s position. For checkpoints, I checked if the player was within the region of the checkpoint and if they were allowed to claim it based on their previous progress.

Animation and Game Loop: The game uses an animation loop powered by requestAnimationFrame, ensuring that the game runs smoothly and updates in real time. Each frame, the canvas is cleared and the updated positions of the player, platforms, and checkpoints are rendered. The loop also checks for user input, updates the game state, and handles game mechanics like collision detection and checkpoint claiming.

Responsive Design: To ensure the game is playable on a variety of screen sizes, I included responsive design techniques by adjusting game elements based on the screen height and width. The game scales dynamically, so whether the player is on a mobile device or desktop, the game remains accessible and visually appealing.

Event Listeners and User Input: I utilized event listeners for capturing keypresses to control the player’s movement. Arrow keys allow the player to move left and right, while the spacebar controls jumping. Additionally, the game includes a start screen and a checkpoint screen, which provide instructions and feedback to the player based on their progress.

Skills Developed:
Through this project, I improved my understanding of:

OOP Principles: Classes, methods, constructors, and inheritance to organize and manage game objects like the player, platforms, and checkpoints.
Collision Detection Algorithms: Handling interactive elements within a 2D game environment.
Game Loop Mechanics: Building a dynamic game that runs continuously and updates based on user interaction and physics.
Canvas Rendering: Efficiently rendering and managing game elements on the canvas for smooth performance.
Event-driven Programming: Responding to user input and controlling gameplay flow based on keypresses and collision events.
This project has not only enhanced my technical skills in game development but also my ability to think critically about user interaction, physics simulation, and responsive design."
